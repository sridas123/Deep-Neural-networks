D:\git\Neuralnet\Graphs\Gradient_mini_batch_100:

contains graphs for mini batch updates for 10 data points for
learning rate of 0.3. Number of epochs=10
The gradient magnitudes with an average has been plotted.
The upper layer has the more variance.
With time, the magnitude of the upper layer decreases and that
of the lower layer increases.
Layer5:

More diff in gradients of the upper and lower layer.

Layer 4:

Less diff in gradients.

Layer3:


Layer2:
